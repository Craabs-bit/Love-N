When you feel down I want you to come back to this message and remember how deeply you are cherished You are such a special person and though I may not say it enough you truly make me happy in ways I can’t fully express You deserve the world and more  

I know things never worked out romantically for us but you were the first person to make me believe in love again You showed me what it means to care deeply to hope  and to dream boldly If there’s another lifetime I would choose you all over again not just for the love we share but for the incredible soul you are  

You are kind loving and deserving of nothing but the best I know you’ve been going through so much lately and I want you to know that you are not alone This pain this struggle it’s not permanent You will make it through this one day at a time  

I’m so proud of you I’m proud of you for doing your best to be okay even when it feels impossible I’m proud of you for waking up every day and trying even when the weight feels unbearable I’m proud of you for being here today because I know some of your yesterdays were really hard  

I don’t know exactly what you’re going through but I know this you are going to get through it You are stronger than you realize braver than you feel and more resilient than you give yourself credit for I hope you fight for yourself even when no one else does I hope you know that you are worthy of your wildest dreams and that you are someone worth fighting for  

Thank you for being the person who makes others feel okay when they’re not okay The world is a kinder brighter place because you are in it Your light touches everyone around you even on the days when you can’t see it yourself  

Keep  fighting Keep believing You are not alone and you are so deeply loved  

Forever in your corner
